## Reach the goals

My life has been a trade-off

If I wanted to reach the goals I set for myself, I had to get at it and stay at it everyday

I had to think about it [all the time]-May be this is the last day- .

I had to get up everyday with my mind set on improving something.

I was driv[en by a ]-des-ire to always be on the [top]-top is anther direction to bottom- of the heap

## Mean Something

I want to do good .

I want the world to be better because I was here

I want [my life ,my work]-If you are not making someone else's life better then you are wasting your time .- ,and my family to mean something


Your life will become better by making other lives better

I want to represent an idea

I want to represent possibilities

I want [to represent an idea]- that you really can make what you want-.

## Protect your dream

Don't ever let someone tell you that you can't do something

Not even me

You got a dream ,you gotta protect it

When people can't do something themselves, they are gonna tell you that you can't do it.

You want something ,go get it
